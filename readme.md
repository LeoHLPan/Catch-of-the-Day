## Useful Notes

- React.Fragment, blank tags
- Comments: { /\* [comment] \*/ }
- Put comments inside returned element so only one thing is returned.
- If page doesn't load after 'npm start', try 'sudo npm start'.
- \$r in console opens up currently selected react object.
- Can write components like a JS function if the component rendered is stateless (Stateless Functional Component).
  - Can call props directly in SFC, given that props is passed as an argument.
  - Can pass object into SFC instead of props.
- Use colon to make variable in route path.
- Buttons/forms submit is done inline: onSubmit={[function]}
- Can create ref in class to pass info between functions: x.createRef().
- Any additional function that uses "this" must use arrow notation.
- this.props.history.push([ext]) can be used to reroute to different page with minimal loading time.
